Goals and Motivation
====================

The Fortran forlab v1.0 is a Fortran module that provides a lot of functions for scientific computing mostly inspired by Matlab and Python's module NumPy.  
Forlab is mainly developed by Keurfon Luu. 

Scope
=====

The goal of the forlab is to achieve the following general scope:

* forlab easy-to-use interface
* ford-api-doc
* multi-precision forlab
* benchmarks
